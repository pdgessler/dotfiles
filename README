DOTFILES for various programs/tools are located here for purposes of sharing with others.

DISCLAIMER: Use these files at your own risk.  I'm not a software person, just a Mechanical Engineer with an interest in computers.  I typically fly by the seat of my pants and figure things out as they break.  That being said, MOST files on here should work without problems.  I try to comment my files liberally, but make sure you update any host-specific paths and understand the code before attempting to use these files.

Thanks, and enjoy!
